== Get the Java Development Kit

CAUTION: To run Enonic XP in development mode, you need the Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.8.92 JDK or newer installed. NB! XP currently dos not support Java 1.9.

=== Check your JDK Version

If you are unsure what JDK version you have (or even if you have one), run the following in your terminal/shell:

  javac -version

This should produce a response such as: `javac 1.8.0_112`
